## Hoi 👋

I'm Martin, an AI Engineer passionate about linguistics, natural language processing, and interpretability. I currently work at the Vienna-based start-up danube.ai, focusing on building AI-enhanced data processing pipelines to be used alongside our recommendation algorithm. This aims to solve choice overload in a way that is explainable, resource-effective, and efficient. 

## 💡 Core Skills and Tech Stack
I mainly use Python for AI-related tasks (PyTorch, Hugging Face, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Pandas, PyDantic, LangFuse, scikit-learn) and build/deploy services with FastAPI/Flask, Docker, Git, Pulumi, and Linux. I also have a strong background in statistics (R, MATLAB), Software Engineering (Java), and basic experience in Web/App Development (TypeScript and React).

## 🔭 Current Projects
My most recent project, [Reosarie](https://github.com/kuma-rtin/Reosarie), builds on my master's thesis on dialectal speech translation. It is a telegram bot with a custom fine-tuned Whisper adapter hosted on a whisper.cpp server to transcribe Swiss German audio messages to Standard German. This is still a work in progress that requires improvements to model fine-tuning, data selection, and observability. Additionally, the app has not yet been deployed.

Other projects include:
- [Eurovision voting analysis](https://github.com/kuma-rtin/eurovision_voting): a statistical analysis of Eurovision Voting point distributions in R that aims to find country collusion patterns.
- [HMM PoS Tagger](https://github.com/kuma-rtin/comp-syntax): a very simple Hidden Markov Model Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagger that I built with coursemates in a class on Computational Syntax

## 📚 Research & Publications
My main research interests include:
- Interpretability
- Low-resource and dialectal NLP
- Speech Processing
- Architectural Optimizations of LLMs and other deep learning models

In the course of my Master's, I participated in several research projects that culminated in publications:
- [Swiss German Speech Translation and the Curse of Multidialectality](https://aclanthology.org/2025.iwslt-1.15/)
- [Robustness of Fine-Tuned Models for Machine Translation with Varying Noise Levels: Insights for Asturian, Aragonese and Aranese](https://aclanthology.org/2024.wmt-1.89/)
- [UM-DFKI Maltese Speech Translation](https://aclanthology.org/2023.iwslt-1.41/)
